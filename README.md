Lessons learnt along the way

- Slice method: basically slice/cuts a part/piece of an array
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => slice(0, 2) => [1, 2]
                => slice(-2)  => [4, 5]

- Join method: converts an array into a string of it own characters with a separator
[1, 2, 3] => join('') => "123"

- Replace method: replace a specified substring
replace('x', 'a') => x is replaced by a

- Split method: returns a string into an array of its own characters
"chai" => ["c", "h", "a", "i"]

- Spread operator: learnt about a specific use case, Math.min doesnt expect an array so the spread operator "spreads" them into individual elements that Math.min wants

- every method: used to check whether all elements in an array passes a test(specified func)
returns a boolean value depends on the outcome

- charAt(index): get a specific char using the index.
